Work in progress!

Development of source 2 demos are moved here. Not sure yet where code for source 1 demos will go.


Project moves fast so no guarantees anything will stay the same.

maybe you can get the project to run if you edit main.rs path to your own demo and run this: 
```rust
cargo run --release
```
requires at least cargo but not too sure about others.


Progress:

- [x] Game events (somewhat done, can list most events (what are type 8 and 9?))
- [x] Server info
- [x] Sendtables
- [x] Serverclasses
- [x] Header
- [ ] Packet entites (This is the most interesting and hardest)
- [ ] User messages
